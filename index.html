    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Be Cautious of Suspicious Links</li>
      <p>
        To protect against malicious links, it's best not to click on any
        suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources. Instead,
        verify the source by visiting the official website or using the app of
        your financial institution.
      </p>
      <li>Utilize Strong Passwords</li>
      <p>
        Use unique, complex passwords for each account, and change them
        periodically. A password manager can help generate and store these
        passwords securely.
      </p>
      <li>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</li>
      <p>
        MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than one form of
        verification, such as a password and a code sent to your phone.
      </p>
      <li>Ensure Device Security</li>
      <p>
        Maintain up-to-date antivirus software and install security updates
        promptly. Research cloud storage providers' security measures and terms
        before storing sensitive information.
      </p>
      <li>Use Personal Devices</li>
      <p>
        Avoid using public computers or devices for financial transactions, and
        ensure strong security measures on your mobile devices and financial
        apps.
      </p>
      <li>Verify Secure Websites</li>
      <p>
        Always ensure you are on a secure website (https://) when accessing
        financial accounts online. Log out after each session and avoid
        multitasking on multiple sites.
      </p>
      <li>Secure Wi-Fi Usage</li>
      <p>
        Be cautious of public Wi-Fi networks and consider using a VPN for added
        security. Secure your home Wi-Fi with encryption and a strong password.
      </p>
      <li>Regularly Review Financial Activity</li>
      <p>
        Check account statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions,
        and report any suspicious activity to your financial institution
        immediately.
      </p>
